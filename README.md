Response for react native quiz


#### How to review?
Every question has a corresponding folder. 

##### Question 1:
```
cd question-1
yarn && yarn start
```

##### Question 2:
Copy the function into a repl environment or your favorite terminal. `node`

##### Question 3:
```
cd question-3
node index.js
```

##### Question 4:
Review refactored code @ /question-4/index.js
I  might've gone crazy with the refactor. I assumed some of the variables wouldn't be needed outside of the if/else block.


##### Question 5:
Got a simple weather app working on IOS. 

```
cd questionFive
yarn && npx pod-install
npx react-native run-ios
```

// Things I would add with more time
- more error handling and notifications
- using geolocation for initial weather
- allow user to add cities to list
- prettier ui
